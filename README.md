# Domino Research

This repo contains projects under active development by the Domino R&D team.
We build tools that help Data Scientists and ML engineers train and deploy ML models.

## Active Projects

Here’s what we’re working on:

- :bridge_at_night: [Bridge](https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-research/tree/main/bridge) - deploy directly from your registry, turning it into a declarative source of truth for your model hosting.

- :passport_control: [Checkpoint](https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-research/tree/main/checkpoint) - adds 'Pull Requests' to your registry to create a better process for promoting models to production.

- :sparkler: [Flare](https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-research/tree/main/flare) - monitor models and get alerts without capturing, storing or processing production inference data.
